<h1>KryptX</h1>
<h2 class="western">Discover several encryption and hashing
algorithms and learn more about their purpose and how they work</h2>
<p>Cryptography is playing a huge part in today's world. This
application allows you to try many encryption and hashing techniques
while giving you detailed information about them. KryptX is not meant
to be a secure solution to encrypt your data. Instead, it aims to
tell you more about the most commonly used systems today, as well as
some old encryption techniques that made history.</p>
<h2 class="western">Features</h2>
<p>- 4 modern encryption tehniques: AES, Blowfish, RSA, DES - 3
historical encryption techniques: Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher,
Enigma M3 - 2 hashing techniques: MD5 &amp; SHA - Each technique
comes with an information box that tells you more about its history
as well as its main features 
</p>
<h2 class="western">How it was made</h2>
<p>- Backend in Python, using Flask - Frontend in HTML-CSS-JavaScript
